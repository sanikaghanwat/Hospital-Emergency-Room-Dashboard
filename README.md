# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard

##  Description 

This project involves the creation of a  Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard  designed to analyze 19 months of patient data to uncover insights that can enhance ER efficiency and improve patient care. The dashboard focuses on key metrics such as patient wait times, satisfaction scores, referral patterns, peak busy periods, and patient demographics. The goal is to optimize resource allocation, staffing, and overall operational efficiency in the emergency room.

##  Key Insights 

-  Patient Wait Time & Satisfaction:   
  - Average wait time: 35.3 minutes  
  - Average satisfaction score: 4.99/10, suggesting room for improvement in patient experience.

-  Referrals:   
  - 5,400 patients didnâ€™t require referrals.  
  - Most common referrals:  
    - General Practice (1,840 cases)  
    - Orthopedics (995 cases)  
    - Physiotherapy (276 cases)  
    - Cardiology (248 cases)

-  Peak Busy Periods:   
  - Busiest days: Mondays (1,377 patients), Saturdays (1,322 patients), and Tuesdays (1,318 patients)  
  - Busiest hours: 11 AM, 7 PM, 1 PM, and 11 PM, indicating the need for additional staff during these periods.

-  Patient Demographics:   
  - Age groups: 30-39 years (1,200 patients), 20-29 years (1,188 patients)  
  - Race distribution:  
    - White: 2,571  
    - African American: 1,951

  - 4,612 patients were admitted to the hospital, while 4,604 were treated and released.

##  Summary 

This project reveals valuable insights into hospital emergency room operations, highlighting areas for improvement in patient care and staffing. The data analysis uncovered high patient volumes, moderate satisfaction levels, and clear trends in peak busy times, which can inform better resource allocation and improve operational efficiency. The diversity of patient demographics further emphasizes the need for tailored care and optimization of hospital processes to meet varying demands.
